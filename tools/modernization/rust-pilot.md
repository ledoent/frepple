# Rust/PyO3 pilot — evidence + decision (Engine track E4)

**Question (MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md §E4):** pilot one isolated module in Rust via PyO3, prove parity
with the C++, measure LOC/perf/safety, and document a go/no-go — "stop = success".

**What was ported.** The JSON number-conversion kernel of `src/utils/json.cpp` —
`getLong` (790–815), `getUnsignedLong` (817–841), `getInt` (865–890): the `double → clamped integer`
and `string → integer` (`atol`) logic. This is the **exact site of the inverted-bound bug** fixed
earlier in the C++ (`< LONG_MIN` had been `> LONG_MIN`, which made `getLong` return `LONG_MIN` for
ordinary doubles). Implementation: `rust/frepple-num/` (a PyO3 extension built with maturin),
decoupled from the C++/CMake build.

## Parity (rust-pilot-parity)

`test/rust_parity/test_parity.py` diffs the Rust extension against a standalone C++ reference
(`tools/rust-pilot/cxx_reference.cpp`) that copies the json.cpp branches **verbatim** — a true
Rust-vs-C++ diff, not a hand-authored expectation. **24/24 vectors pass** locally and in CI:

- **19 "agree" vectors** (normal values, truncation toward zero, out-of-range saturation, string
  parses) match the C++ reference byte-for-byte — including the regression case `clamp_to_long(5.0) → 5`
  (the C++ bug returned `LONG_MIN` here).
- **5 "rust_safe" vectors** exercise inputs the C++ leaves **undefined**, where Rust is defined:
  `NaN → 0` (C++ `static_cast<long>(NaN)` is UB), `±inf → i64::MIN/MAX`, and `negative → unsigned`
  saturates to `0` (the C++ has no lower clamp and wraps to a huge value).

## Measurements (rust-measured)

| Metric | C++ (`json.cpp` getters) | Rust (`frepple-num`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LOC (the three getters / the four ported fns) | 98 | 35 |
| Clamp kernel — the bug site | ~4 hand-written lines per getter (`if d > MAX … else if d < MIN …`) | **1 line** (`x as i64`, saturating) |
| `unsafe` blocks in the conversion logic | n/a (all C++ is unsafe by nature) | **0** (compile-enforced by `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`) |
| Float→int out-of-range | manual clamp (got it wrong once) | saturating by language definition |
| `NaN` handling | UB (`static_cast`) | defined (`→ 0`) |
| Perf | in-process, a few instructions | ~39 ns/call **including** the Python→Rust FFI hop; the arithmetic itself is a few instructions, same as C++ |

Notes on fairness: the C++ getters are larger partly because they dispatch the full JSON tagged union
(8 type cases); the Rust port covers the numeric kernel that carried the bug. Perf is **not** the
differentiator — this is a leaf conversion, not a hot path, and both compile to a handful of
instructions; the ~39 ns is dominated by the Python FFI boundary (irrelevant here). The headline is
**safety**, not speed.

## Safety / maintainability assessment

- The specific shipped bug (inverted clamp) and two latent UB sinks (`NaN` cast, negative→unsigned
  wrap) are **all impossible or defined** in safe Rust — for free, via saturating `as` casts.
- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` makes "zero unsafe in our logic" a **compile-time guarantee**, not a
  review promise. The only `unsafe` is inside the vetted `pyo3` FFI glue — unavoidable for *any*
  Python extension, and a tiny audited surface vs. the C++ engine which is unsafe in its entirety.
- `cargo test` runs the logic with **zero Python/toolchain dependency** (pyo3 is an optional,
  feature-gated dep), so the numeric core is unit-tested in isolation in ~5 s.

## Build / integration cost

- maturin wheel, **no CMake/Cargo coupling** (Option A). Standalone CI job
  (`.github/workflows/rust-pilot.yml`): `cargo test` + build the C++ ref + maturin build + parity
  `pytest`, ~1–2 min, independent of the slow engine build and the staging deploy.
- A Rust toolchain in the *engine image* (~150 MB) is **deferred** — only needed if we ship the wheel,
  which is a "go"-only fast-follow.

## Forecast-method conversion progress

Porting `src/forecast/` method-by-method (each a CI-only parity slice). Status:

| Method | Rust | Parity vs C++ ref | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MovingAverage | `forecast.rs` | ✅ | the `weight[]` OOB site |
| SingleExponential | `single_exp.rs` | ✅ | 1D Levenberg-Marquardt; shared `common.rs` extracted |
| DoubleExponential | `double_exp.rs` | ✅ | 2D Marquardt + 2x2 Hessian (shared `solve_2x2_marquardt`) |
| Croston | `croston.rs` | ✅ | intermittent demand; alfa grid-search, upper-only outliers |
| Seasonal | `seasonal.rs` | ✅ | Holt-Winters; autocorrelation cycle detection + seasonal-factor state (period/force/S_i all parity-checked) |

**All five forecast methods ported and parity-verified** (57 parity tests; smape/stddev/forecast within
1e-9, outliers/period/force/seasonal-factors exact). Shared helpers in `common.rs` (`smape_weight`,
weight table, constants, the `Forecast` result, `solve_2x2_marquardt` — bit-for-bit with the C++
damping/singular-retry order, used by DoubleExp + Seasonal).

## Phase 7 — engine integration (C ABI + the byte-parity finding)

**Done + CI-covered:** the crate now also builds a `staticlib` with a C ABI
(`src/capi.rs` + `tools/rust-pilot/frepple_forecast.h`) — `extern "C"` wrappers for all five methods,
the *only* `unsafe` in the crate (the FFI boundary; the numeric modules stay `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`).
A committed C harness (`tools/rust-pilot/capi_harness.c`) links `libfrepple_forecast.a` and calls the
methods exactly as `libfrepple` would (MovingAverage→8.0, Seasonal→period 7), run in the `rust-pilot`
CI. So the FFI link that the engine integration needs is proven.

**Key finding — byte-exact parity needs `-ffp-contract=off`.** The Rust matches the standalone C++
reference to ~1e-9 but **not** bit-for-bit (~14/33 vectors exact). Cause: `g++ -O2` defaults to
`-ffp-contract=fast` (FMA fusion of `a*b+c` into one rounding); rustc does not contract. So the engine
(C++, FMA-on) and the Rust port differ by a few ULPs on the same inputs. Implications for the remaining
flag-gated dispatch + `forecast_*` golden run:
- Method *selection* is robust — a ULP-level `smape` difference won't flip the lowest-error winner.
- The forecast *values* differ by ULPs; whether the `.expect` golden output stays byte-identical depends
  on its print precision. The clean way to guarantee it is to build the forecast translation unit with
  `-ffp-contract=off` (matching Rust), which the integration should set.

**Remaining (the gated "go" step, needs the full engine build to validate):** add the cargo staticlib to
CMake under `option(FREPPLE_RUST_FORECAST OFF)`, swap each C++ `generateForecast` body for the
`extern "C"` call behind the flag, build the engine image with `rustup` (buildx-cached), and add a
`ubuntu24` CI leg that builds `-DFREPPLE_RUST_FORECAST=ON -ffp-contract=off` and runs `runtest.py` over
`test/forecast_*`. Flip the default ON only if that leg is green; otherwise the byte-parity gap above is
the recorded "stop" datapoint. This phase can't be validated on the macOS dev box (the engine build is
Linux-only here), so it's CI-gated and default-OFF (zero risk to the shipping engine).

## Slice 2 — forecast (MovingAverage), the real algorithm

Slice 1 was a trivial clamp; slice 2 ports an actual forecasting method:
`ForecastSolver::MovingAverage::generateForecast` (`src/forecast/timeseries.cpp:294-384`) + the
`smapeWeight` recency weighting (`forecast.h:3041-3054`) — the **other fixed memory-bug site** (the
`weight[]` out-of-bounds read on histories longer than `MAXBUCKETS=500`). Crate: `rust/frepple-forecast/`.

- **Parity** (`test/rust_parity/test_forecast_parity.py`, **10/10**): the Rust `moving_average` is diffed
  against a verbatim C++ reference (`tools/rust-pilot/forecast_reference.cpp`) over constant / trend /
  outlier / intermittent / fractional series **and** two >`MAXBUCKETS` series (the OOB case). `smape`,
  `standarddeviation` and `avg` match within a 1e-9 relative epsilon (same f64 op order); outlier index
  sets match exactly.
- **LOC: comparable, not smaller** — Rust ~109 (incl. the weight-table helper + result struct +
  explicit-index loops) vs ~73 for the C++ method body (+~10 for `smapeWeight`/weight init). On a tight
  numeric loop, safe Rust is *roughly the same size*; the win here is **not** LOC.
- **Safety:** **0 `unsafe`** (compile-enforced); the `weight[]` OOB read is impossible — indexing is
  bounds-checked and the clamp is one line. The engine-model coupling (the two `new ProblemOutlier(...)`
  writes) is the only thing left in C++; the port returns outlier indices instead (numeric kernel, not
  the model mutation).
- **Honest caveat:** parity required mirroring the C++ float operation order exactly. That's the cost of
  a numeric port — bit-level reproducibility is a real constraint, and a careless rewrite would drift.

## Decision (rust-decision)

**Conditional GO — for targeted Rust on isolated, numeric, safety-critical leaf modules; NO-GO for a
wholesale engine rewrite.**

The evidence across both slices is consistent: Rust eliminates *this exact class* of memory/UB bug by
construction (the json clamp and the forecast `weight[]` OOB), at a low, decoupled integration cost and
no meaningful perf trade-off. LOC is **not** the headline — slice 2 showed safe Rust is roughly the same
size as the C++ for tight numeric code; the value is the compile-enforced safety + the clean PyO3 linkage
(no manual refcounting — the very `python.cpp` refcount/UB bugs the modernization fixed). That justifies
continuing **incrementally**: the next forecast slices (SingleExponential / DoubleExponential / Seasonal /
Croston — iterative optimisers) port behind the same maturin/PyO3 pattern, with the C++ remaining the
shipping path until a method reaches full golden-parity; if a method proves too entangled to port cleanly,
that itself is recorded evidence.

A full rewrite of the deeply C++-coupled engine (object graph, embedded CPython, solver) is **not**
justified by this evidence — the cost/risk is enormous and most of the engine is not the bug-prone,
isolatable, numeric code where Rust's guarantees pay off cleanly. "Targeted, evidence-gated, leaf-first"
is the supported path; "rewrite the engine" is not.
